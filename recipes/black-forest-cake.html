        <li>2 and a half sachets whipping cream stiffener</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>

        <li>2 sachets whipping cream stiffener</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <h4>Baking the cake</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Line a springform tin (10 inches/26 centimeters) with baking parchment and grease lightly. Set it aside for now.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to <strong>375</strong> Fahrenheit (<strong>190</strong> Celsius).</li>
        <li>Divide the eggs, keeping the egg whites in a large bowl and putting the egg yolks into their own. Whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt until you get stiff peaks. Set them aside.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar and vanilla extract to the bowl with the egg yolks and mix until light and fluffy. This should take around 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix the flour with baking powder, cornstarch, and cocoa powder and sift on top of the egg yolks mixture.</li>
        <li>Mix carefully, then add the stiff egg whites in, folding by several portions (folding is a mixing technique). Add the melted butter and mix it in.</li>
        <li>Fill the batter into the prepared baking tin and bake for 25-30 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cake.</li>
        <li>Take out of the oven and let it cool down in the tin for about 15 minutes, then remove carefully and let it cool down completely on a wire rack.</li>
      </ol>
    Note: At your discretion, you can bake the cake up to a day in advance.
    <h4>Making it pretty</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Add the cherries intended for the filling into a sieve and let drain, collecting the liquid in a pot.
          <ul>
            <li>Add the lemon juice, sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon. Mix in.</li>
            <li>Heat up until the mix starts to thicken, then take off the heat and mix the cherry schnapps in.</li>
            <li>Add the drained cherries and mix them in. Now set aside.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cut the cake horizontally into three even layers. Place the first layer on a serving plate in a cake ring.
          <ul>
            <li>Mix the cherry schnapps with water or cherry juice and brush it onto the cake layer.</li>
            <li>Add the cherry filling on top - keep about 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) on the edges free of the filling.</li>
            <li>Place in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For the cream filling, add the cold heavy cream to a bowl.
          <ul>
            <li>Mix the whipping cream stiffener with sugar and vanilla sugar, then add gradually to the bowl with the heavy cream, whipping constantly until you see stiff peaks have formed.</li>
            <li>Add about half of the cream filling on top of the cherries in the cake ring and smooth out the top.</li>
            <li>Add the second cake layer on top and brush this layer with the schnapps mixture as well.</li>
            <li>Spread the remaining whipped cream on top and finish with the last cake layer. Brush again with schnapps, then leave in the refrigerator for one hour.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Whip the cold heavy cream for the filling with stiffener and vanilla sugar until stiff peaks form.
          <ul>
            <li>Take about 6-8 tablespoons of that and fill into a piping bag with a star tip, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Use the rest of the whipped cream and cover the cake with it.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the sides with chocolate shavings, decorate the top with 12 cream swirls along the edges, and place a cherry on each swirl.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the center with some chocolate shavings.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Leave the cake in the refrigerator for <em>at least 2 hours</em>. Your Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte is finished. Congratulations!</li>
