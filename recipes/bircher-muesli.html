    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    To start out, here are the original ingredients of Dr. Bircher's Muesli - but don't forget about the flexibility of this recipe - mix it up to your heart's content!
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 large apple, unpeeled and grated</li>
        <li>chopped nuts, hazelnut, almond, or walnut</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Add everything but the nuts into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Let it sit in the refrigerator, preferrably overnight (but at the <em>very</em> least for one hour).</li>
        <li>Mix in the nuts as a topping.</li>
        <li>If the mixture is too thick, add a bit of water, milk, juice, or anything wet. That's all there is to it!</li>
      </ol>
    <h4>Here are a few extra suggestions to swap in or add on!</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Some yogurt or any other milk variation in place of the condensed milk.</li>
        <li>Dried fruit in place of (or alongside) the nuts.</li>
        <li>Fresh berries in place of (or alongside) the apple.</li>
        <li>Orange juice, apple juice, or even nothing in place of the lemon juice.</li>
        <li>A drizzle of honey, maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, etc.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle on some seeds, sunflower, chia, etc.</li>
      </ul>
